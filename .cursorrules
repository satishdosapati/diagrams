# Project Rules for Diagrams Project

## Documentation Files
- **DO NOT** create unnecessary .md files when asking questions or seeking clarification
- Only create documentation files when explicitly requested or when documenting significant features/changes
- Prefer inline code comments and existing documentation files over creating new .md files

## Code Style
- Follow existing code patterns and architecture
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging and observability

## Integration Guidelines
- When integrating new services (like MCP servers), use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Always include fallback mechanisms for external service failures
- Log all external service interactions for debugging
